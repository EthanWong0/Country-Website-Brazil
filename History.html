			<p class="text">In the year 1500, Pedro Alvares Cabral arrived in Brazil with multiple Portuguese sailors after failing to arrive at their orignial destination, South Africa. Brazil became a colony of the Portuguese as they claimed the land for themselves in order to profit off of it. Using things such as the production of "Brazilwood", which was a red wood found from trees in Brazil which quickly became one of their main exports. Sugar, which was processed from sugar cane grown in Brazil in "engenhos", which translate to mill or machine. and later even mining gold in order to profit off of their newfound colony. In order to support this they needed labor, which they got from slaves, who had to do all the labor and were treated very poorly while their masters profited off them.</p>

			<p class="text">During the end of the 19th century, Emperor Pedro II was no longer a beloved or popular leader. With positivism influencing Brazilian society and politics and with the Golden Rule freeing all of the slaves in 1888, Brazilians wanted a different sort of government. The elites in Brazil staged a coup in 1889, creating a Republic which focused on building the economy and increasing the amount of white people in its population. <br> <br> <br> </p>

			<p class="text">Positivism, introduced by Auguste Comte, is a philosophy that believes that sensory experiences and logical and their mathematical treatment are the only source of worthwhile. Essentially rejecting traditional philosophies and other beliefs not based in fact and science, such as religious beliefs. This philosophy spread like wildfire in Brazil, with many questioning things such as monarchy, the Church and slavery. Greatly influencing ideas and wants for reform based on positivism. Such as ideas of the separation of civil  and religious marriage and the abolition of slavery.</p>
